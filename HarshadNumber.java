	   A Harshad number (also known as a Niven number) is a positive integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. 
	   The term "Harshad" comes from the Sanskrit words "har" (meaning "joy") and "shad" (meaning "give"), collectively meaning "joy-giver." 
	     Examples:
            18: The sum of its digits is 1 + 8 = 9, and 18 is divisible by 9.
			1729: The sum of its digits is 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19, and 1729 is divisible by 19.
