	A perfect number is a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. 
	For example:
	         6: Divisors are 1, 2, and 3; 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
             28: Divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14; 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
	The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128.
