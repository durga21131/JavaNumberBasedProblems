        An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, pluperfect digital invariant, or PPDI) 
        is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
        Steps to Check an Armstrong Number:
              1. Count the number of digits d.
              2. Separate the digits of the number.
              3. Raise each digit to the power d and compute the sum.
              4. Check if the sum equals the original number.
        Example:
        153 = 1*1*1+5*5*5+3*3*3 = 1+125+27 =153
        here number of digits is 3 (1,5,3) and individual digits are 1,5,3.
